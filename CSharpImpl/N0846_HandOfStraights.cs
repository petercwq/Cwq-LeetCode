    /// Alice has a hand of cards, given as an array of integers.
    /// Now she wants to rearrange the cards into groups so that each group is size W, and consists of W consecutive cards.
    /// Return true if and only if she can.
    /// 
    /// 
    /// Example 1:
    /// Input: hand = [1,2,3,6,2,3,4,7,8], W = 3
    /// Output: true
    /// Explanation: Alice's hand can be rearranged as [1,2,3],[2,3,4],[6,7,8].
    /// 
    /// Example 2:
    /// Input: hand = [1,2,3,4,5], W = 4
    /// Output: false
    /// Explanation: Alice's hand can't be rearranged into groups of 4.
    /// 
    /// 
    /// Constraints:
    /// * 1 <= hand.length <= 10000
    /// * 0 <= hand[i] <= 10^9
    /// * 1 <= W <= hand.length
    /// Note: This question is the same as 1296: https://leetcode.com/problems/divide-array-in-sets-of-k-consecutive-numbers/
